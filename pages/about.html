        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>It all began one day when Kason went to his pantry to get some gluten-free pasta (a staple in his house) for
          his dinner. He realized that he had run out and he couldn't believe it! He ALWAYS had gluten-free pasta in his
          pantry, but somehow, he forgot to buy some the last time he went to the store.</p>

        <p>He was telling his friends Ryan, Stefanie, and Rahzae about his frustration, and they all chimed in with
          their
          own similar stories, and how they wished there was a way to track their grocery items so they could replace
          them
          before they ran out, or ensure they were used before they passed their expiration date.</p>
        <p>And foodWise was born....</p>
