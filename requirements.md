## Scope (In/Out)
- IN - What will your product do
    - Describe the individual features that your product will do.
    - High overview of each. Only need to list 4-5
    - Example:
        - The web app will provide information to the users about all the different Cat Cafe’s in the area
        - The web app will provide both walking and driving directions to each of the destinations
        - Users will be able to “Star” their favorite shops.
        - Each shop will contain reviews of the customer’s experiences

- OUT - What will your product NOT do
    - These should be features that you will make very clear from the beginning that you will not do during development. These should be limited and very few. Pick your battles wisely. This should only be 1 or 2 things. Example: My website will never turn into an IOS or Android app.
