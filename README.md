*Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?*
## Regular check-ins at 9am
- Recap the day before
    - Successes
    - Failures
    - How are you doing, feeling about your work, your contributions to the project
- Review the upcoming day 
    - What do we need to finish from yesterday 
    - What (else) can we accomplish today 
    - Who will be working on what?
### Daily wrap-up

## Conflict Plan
*Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.*

**What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?**
Determine how much we care about certain things (scale of 1 to 5), the person with a lower score should be potentially be willing to concede to the person to whom it matters more. Give each party the floor for a short uninterrupted period of time to state their case.

**What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?**
If someone has concerns with another individual, bring it up with them in a 1-on-1 setting and not with the entire group. Be mindful, ask questions, be empathetic. 

**How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?**
If someone has concerns with another individual, bring it up with them in a 1-on-1 setting and not with the entire group. Be mindful, ask questions, be empathetic. 

**How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?**
Regular check-ins and communication. If something is unclear with someone, ask for help. If someone asks you for clarification, teach them.

**How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?**
Maintain professionalism. If concerns aren't addressed in 1-on-1 scenario, discuss with other teammates(?), then escalate to Sara maybe?
***
## Communication Plan
*Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.*

**What hours will you be available to communicate?**
Rahzae - whatever works for PSTers
Ryan - 9am until midnight PST
Kason - 9am until midnight PST
Stefanie - 9am until midnight PST

**What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?**
Slack and Remo

**How often will you take breaks?**
As needed, communicate when you may need one, try to take a break every hour

**What is your plan if you start to fall behind?**
Work more, sleep less. j/k. Review the end goal and Minimum Viable Product (MVP), see if we can eliminate less critical elements or move to a stretch goal

**How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?**
Phone numbers added in group Slack.

**What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?**
After you speak, ask someone else their thoughts.

**How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?**
Don't shit on anyone's ideas. Be a good human.
***
## Work Plan
*Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.*

**How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?**
All of these will be addressed in our regular stand-ups. 

**What project management tool will be used?**
Probably GitHub Project? Maybe Trello.
***
## Git Process
*Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.*

**What components of your project will live on GitHub?**
Everything except private or personal information

**How will you share the repository with your teammates?**
Via Git Organization - all members are Admins
Once repo is added, we will all push up on different branches daily

**What is your Git flow?**
Start the day by pulling down the codebase. Stay in communication to ensure we're not duplicating efforts or potential merge conflicts.

**Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:**
**How many people must review a PR?**
Two reviews for main branch, one review for staging branch
**Who merges PRs?**
Whoever feels most confident in someone else's code. If not confident, leave comments in the pull request to ask for another of set of eyes on a line of code for example.

**How often will you merge?**
At least once a day.

**How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?**
Depends, will communicate with the team via Slack if not all members are in Remo.
