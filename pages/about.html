            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>It all began one day when Kason went to his pantry to get some gluten-free pasta (a staple in his house) for his dinner. He realized that he had run out and he couldn't believe it! He ALWAYS had gluten-free pasta in his pantry, but somehow, he forgot to buy some the last time he went to the store.</p>
            
            <p>He was telling his friends Ryan, Stefanie, and Rahzae about his frustration, and they all chimed in with their own similar stories, and how they wished there was a way to track their grocery items so they could replace them before they ran out, or ensure they were used before they passed their expiration date.</p>
            
            <p>And FoodWise was born....</p>
